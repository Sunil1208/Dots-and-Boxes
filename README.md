# Dots-and-Boxes
An interactive two player dots and boxes game.

To change the number of grids, reinitialise the (const GRID_SIZE = 2;)
for eg.. if you want 5X5 grid, set const GRID_SIZE = 5;

Color configuration
const boardColor = "lightgrey"          //Colour of the board
const borderColor = "black"             //Color of the border of the board
const COLOR_COMP = "crimson"            //Player 2 colour when selected
const COLOR_COMP_LIT = "lightpink"      //Player 2 color(highlight)
const COLOR_PLAY = "royalblue"          //Player 1 colour when selected
const COLOR_PLAY_LIT = "lightsteelblue" //Player 1 color (highlight)
const COLOR_DOT = "sienna";             //Colour of the dot
const COLOR_TIE = "black"
